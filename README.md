# Arty Z7-20 and Linux Development
This repository documents the process of initial bring-up for the
Digilent Arty Z7-20 development board as a platform for embedded
hardware and software development.

- QEMU emulation
- U-boot and FSBL integration
- Device tree creation and kernel configuration
- Some tooling and LSP setup for kernel development
- Debian-based rootfs and board validation

The goal here is to describe the process of preparing the Arty and a
Linux development environment as a reliable and reproducible platform
for RTL and driver development, integration, test and validation.
